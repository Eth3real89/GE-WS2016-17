Scarlet Concept:
	Mechanic around light/dark
		in the light: normal teenage girl
		in the dark:  paranormal being (no definition wanted)
			used for:	
				Combat: dark > light <-- effectiveness based on feeding level and darkness
				Feeding dark > light <-- consume enemy / ally / neutral person
				NPC COOP: dark < light <-- potential for riddles based on this
				Stealth: dark < light <-- blend in normal people when feeding is sufficient
			Screen gets a red tint, "tunnel vision", sound of heartbeat ("bloodlust" mode)
	
	monster appearance never shown --> hinted at with red glowing eyes and blood shimmering claws in the darkness as well as inhuman screaching, growling or general noise
	
	artstyle: red tones dominant and sharp, other colors very washed out / unsaturated

	feeding for health replenish

	Bar which tracks Monstrosity/Humanity ? 
		Humanity Full: Maximum Strength and Abilities, Silent, no impairments
		Monstrosity Full: Maximum Weakness and no Abilities, No control about shrieks, easier to detect in general

	Boss Fights:
		- unlock Z axis, lock Y axis and have boss battles based on bullet hell avoidance
		- have boss vulnerable after each phase or all the time?
		- 2-3 phases
		- 5 bosses?
			* Agreed Bosses:
				- Vampire:
					* possible setting: plaza in a city (hexagonal, octagonal, circle?)

					* possible phases:
						* ranged combat with AoE / Bullets
						* ranged combat with AoE / Bullets -> different pattern, melee?
						* Rage Phase -> massive avoidance, boss invulnerable, boss defeated after phase

				- Werewolf:
					* possible setting: clearing of a forest (square?, allow vertical movement like strike from above?)
					
					* possible phases:
						* stealth melee combat-> striking from the shadows 
						* pair stealth melee combat with longer combos and outright frontal attacks
						* Rage Phase -> Furious flurry of attack which start in rapid succession but get consecutively slower as boss gets tired, boss can’t be counter-attacked

			* Proposed Bosses: (Reload mechanic —> Revolver) —> Fore-Shadowed in Foreground of previous Boss Kill Cinematics
				- Human -> Angel (make it appear that you fight a demon hunter of sorts, which reveals herself to be an angel during the fight, needs cutscene for maximum effect, can be done without though, music for that will be challenging):
					* possible setting: castle, palace, church, cathedral (square or ellipsis)
					* concept conceived as final boss -> 1 additional phase for that WTF moment when player realises he will be getting rekt

					* Ranged Combat with bullets of light, while actively avoiding player attacks if that path is chosen
					* Ranged Combat with harder pattern, more bullets, else same as above
					* Rage Phase 1: Angel is revealed (wings of light and halo of light), produces melee weapon (scythe?), pairs her Phase 2 ranged attacks with melee attacks
					* Rage Phase 2: Angel performs only melee attacks in furious combos which end in AoE (animating this will be challenging)
