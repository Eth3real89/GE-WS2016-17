Scarlet Concept:
	Mechanic around light/dark
		in the light: normal teenage girl
		in the dark:  paranormal being (no definition wanted)
			used for:	
				Combat: dark > light <-- effectiveness based on feeding level and darkness
				Feeding dark > light <-- consume enemy / ally / neutral person
				NPC COOP: dark < light <-- potential for riddles based on this
				Stealth: dark < light <-- blend in normal people when feeding is sufficient
			Screen gets a red tint, "tunnel vision", sound of heartbeat ("bloodlust" mode)
	
	monster appearance never shown --> hinted at with red glowing eyes and blood shimmering claws in the darkness as well as inhuman screaching, growling or general noise
	
	artstyle: red tones dominant and sharp, other colors very washed out / unsaturated

	feeding for health replenish

	Bar which tracks Monstrosity/Humanity ? 
		Humanity Full: Maximum Strength and Abilities, Silent, no impairments
		Monstrosity Full: Maximum Weakness and no Abilities, No control about shrieks, easier to detect in general

	Boss Fights:
		- unlock Z axis, lock Y axis and have boss battles based on bullet hell avoidance
		- have boss vulnerable after each phase or all the time?
		- 2-3 phases
		- 4 bosses?
			* Agreed Bosses:
				- Vampire:
					* possible setting: plaza in a city (hexagonal, octagonal, circle?)

					* possible phases:
						* ranged combat with AoE / Bullets
						* ranged combat with AoE / Bullets -> different pattern, melee?
						* Rage Phase -> massive avoidance, boss invulnerable, boss defeated after phase

				- Werewolf:
					* possible setting: clearing of a forest (square?, allow vertical movement like strike from above?)
					
					* possible phases:
						* stealth melee combat-> striking from the shadows 
						* pair stealth melee combat with longer combos and outright frontal attacks
						* Rage Phase -> Furious flurry of attack which start in rapid succession but get consecutively slower as boss gets tired, boss can’t be counter-attacked

			* (Reload mechanic —> Revolver) —> Fore-Shadowed in Foreground of previous Boss Kill Cinematics
				- Human -> Angel (make it appear that you fight a demon hunter of sorts, which reveals herself to be an angel during the fight, needs cutscene for maximum effect, can be done without though, music for that will be challenging):
					* possible setting: castle, palace, church, cathedral (square or ellipsis)
					* concept conceived as final boss -> 1 additional phase for that WTF moment when player realises he will be getting rekt

					* Ranged Combat with bullets of light, while actively avoiding player attacks if that path is chosen
					* Ranged Combat with harder pattern, more bullets, else same as above
					* Rage Phase 1: Angel is revealed (wings of light and halo of light), produces melee weapon (scythe?), pairs her Phase 2 ranged attacks with melee attacks
					* Rage Phase 2: Angel performs only melee attacks in furious combos which end in AoE (animating this will be challenging)

	
			* Proposed new Boss:
				- Fairies (optional secret, cave, fairy lair)
					* Scarlet battles two fairies at the same time (two separate health bars; for each fairy one)
					* one fairy takes over a suit of armour with a sword (engulfed in light) engaging Scarlet in melee combat
					* the other fairy engages Scarlet in ranged combat (light bulltes, AEs, Beams) and shrouds itself in light

					* The unarmored fairy has 4 (needs testing) hits per phase and opens windows of opportunity because of exhaustion once in a while; after getting hit bei Scarlet the fairy recovers its shroud of light
					* The armoured fairy has a usual health bar depletable by Scarlet’s melee attacks with perk affection

					* possible phases:
						* the armoured fairy chases Scarlet around the room trying to hit Scarlet with its sword while the other fairy attacks with patterns of Bullets, AE and Beams
						* the armoured fairy circles Scarlet and charges in fast to strike and stun her (massive attack tracking, unparryable), while the other fairy shoots a beam or AE at Scarlet’s location (normal attack tracking)
						* the armoured fairy died in the last phase, so the last fairy furiously fires everything it got towards Scarlet while it is shrouded in light; when the fairy is exhausted Scarlet hits her for half health and
							the fairy takes over the armour and engulfs it in light and furiously attacks Scarlet with the sword (parryable and dashable for distance); when exhausted the fairy can be killed
